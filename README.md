# Advent of Code 2024

## Goals during the event

- Explore- and make use of Python syntax that can still be considered new to me, such as e.g.
  - Added before the event started
    - dataclass.
    - lambda.
    - map().
    - reduce().
    - zip().
  - Added after the event started
    - regex.
    - Counter().
    - all().
- Collect at least 20 stars.

## Possible repeats

When time allows, for learning purposes, it might be beneficial to repeat some days using a different strategy.

- Day 3
  - Don't use regex.
- Day 4
  - Don't use regex.
  - Don't fetch all diagonals (part 1).
  - Use a sliding window (part 1).
