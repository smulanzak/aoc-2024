# Advent of Code 2024

## Priority

1) Python.
2) Go.

## Goals

- Explore- and make use of Python syntax that can still be considered new to me, such as e.g.
  - dataclass.
  - lambda.
  - map().
  - reduce().
- If possible, repeat daily challenges using the Go programming language, using more of a brute-force approach.
- Collect at least 30 stars.

## Status

Stars: 2/50.

- Day 1
  - Part 1: Python, Go.
  - Part 2: Python, Go.
